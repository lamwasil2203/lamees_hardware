                    Good Morning Lamees... How can I help you today ? Said Claude when I asked it to help me debug my profolio.
                    Therefore, I decide to dedicate this project to myself...Lamees.

                        The goal of this project was to get familar with how to solder and use a soldering iron.
                        Which looked easy at first but proved to be quite challenging.

                    <p>
                        I started by watching a few tutorials on how to solder and use a soldering iron.
                        Then I went into the lab and started soldering... And I got it working (eventually).

                            This project was a great learning experience. I learned a lot about how to solder and use a soldering iron.
                            I also learned a lot about the importance of patience and precision. Before going into the lab I did not have an idea of what I wanted my sculpture to look like.
                            I wanted to make endless circles but that proved to be quite challenging. I restarted the sculpture and realized that there were letter at the top of the protoboard. 
                            I remembered that I just created a porfolio with my name on it... So I decided to make a sculpture of my name as a nice welcome to the website.
                            I am not the most artistic person but I tried to make the sculpture have more a sentimental meaning.

                            <span>Solution: I tried to be more stable and took a bit more time to solder the pins.</span>
